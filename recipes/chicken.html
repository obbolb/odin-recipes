    <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Chicken:
          <ul>
            <li>In a large pot, bring enough water to cover the chicken to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken, ginger slices, crushed garlic, smashed lemongrass, and a generous pinch of salt to the pot.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and poach the chicken for about 45-60 minutes, or until fully cooked. You can check doneness by inserting a knife into the thigh; the juices should run clear when done.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the chicken from the pot and let it cool. Save the chicken broth for cooking the rice.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the Rice:
          <ul>
            <li>Wash the jasmine rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, heat a little oil and add minced garlic and ginger slices. Saut√© until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the washed rice to the saucepan and stir to coat the rice with the aromatics.</li>
            <li>Pour in the chicken broth (use the broth from boiling the chicken), add pandan leaves (if using), and season with salt. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for an additional 10 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Assemble Khao Man Gai:
          <ul>
            <li>Once the chicken has cooled, rub the skin with a little salt. Then, chop the chicken into serving-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>To serve, place a portion of the fragrant jasmine rice on a plate, top with slices of poached chicken, and garnish with cucumber slices and cilantro sprigs.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
