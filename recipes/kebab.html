        <li>1.5 pounds (680g) boneless lamb, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh cilantro or parsley, chopped</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the yogurt, olive oil, minced garlic, ground cumin, ground coriander, paprika, ground cinnamon, ground turmeric, cayenne pepper, salt, black pepper, lemon juice, lemon zest, and chopped cilantro or parsley. Mix everything together well.</li>
        <li>Place the lamb cubes in a zip-top bag or a shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the lamb, ensuring that each piece is well-coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight for the best flavor.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (around 400-450°F or 200-230°C).</li>
        <li>Thread the marinated lamb cubes onto the skewers, alternating with pieces of vegetables if desired. This will add extra flavor and color to your kebabs.</li>
        <li>Place the skewers on the preheated grill and cook for about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, or until the lamb reaches your desired level of doneness. Lamb is typically best enjoyed medium-rare to medium, but adjust the cooking time to your preference.</li>
        <li>Remove the lamb kebabs from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes. Serve hot with your favorite side dishes, such as rice, pita bread, or a fresh salad. You can also garnish with additional chopped cilantro or parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice.</li>
      </ol>
